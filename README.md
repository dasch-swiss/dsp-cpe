# DspCpe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests. This command requires a local instance of the app running as well as the mock api. Running this command will open the Cypress tools. Select the browser of your choice and click the green `Start` button. Once the browser opens, click on the `.cy.ts` spec file you wish to run.

## Rollbar error logging

To test Rollbar locally, enable it in `config.dev.json` and add the `post_client_item` token found in the `DSP-CPE` project on Rollbar. Afterwards, any error thrown will be logged to Rollbar.
